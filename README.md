# senior-captsone-spring-2025

# Overview 
This repository contains the code we have been writing as a part of our final, senior capstone project-- the last requirement for undergraduates at the University of Illinois Springfield pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. This project must be completed and turned in by May 2, 2025, at 11:59 PM Central Time. 

## Mockups
Full disclosure: The mockups were generated by ChatGPT based on my prompt for what I want the final product to look like, but there is still a lot to be done. Values are hardcoded here when I want them to be entered by the user, they need to be stored in a DB, I want to change the look, add more ways to sort, and keep things secure with logins/accounts, etc.

But these are 2 ideas. If I/we come up with more ideas, they'll get their own mockups and will end up here. We'll also store the code we actually end up delivering in this repo.

## Chosen Plan 
We have chosen to develop a job-tracking application that will help users track, view, sort, and filter changes in their job applications (like newly submitted applications, offers, rejections, interviews, etc.) 

## Tech Stack
We are building the back end with the Java SpringBoot framework, the front end with React/JS, and the database with PostgreSQL. As of 2/19/25, the database is hosted locally, but it will eventually be on Supabase using their free plan. Supabase will also handle things like authentication, security, etc.
